//It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, 
//the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.





//Solution
function removeChar(str){
    //You got this!
     let newStr=str.substring(1,str.length-1)
     return newStr
   
   };
