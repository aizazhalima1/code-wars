//For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"





//Solution
function cookie(x){
    if(typeof(x)=='string'){
      return 'Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!'
    }
     else if(typeof(x)=='number'){
       return 'Who ate the last cookie? It was Monica!'
     }
     else{
       return 'Who ate the last cookie? It was the dog!'
     }
   }
